# pth Root Computations Over Field Extensions

Sage implementations to extract p-th roots of polynomials in extension fields, using polynomial basis.

I have used this code to obtain results for my master's thesis. An article describing the method
is available [here](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/el.2015.3091).

I will share the thesis pdf here when it is available online.
